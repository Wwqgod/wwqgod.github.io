## Pokemon Aura Mew Distribution Cartridge GBA ROM

**About the Aura Mew Distribution Cartridge**

This is the distribution cartridge used for the Aura Mew event distribution in the United Kingdom, then later other European counties.

In the United Kingdom the Aura Mew was distributed at participating Toys "R" Us stores as part of the Pokémon Summer Day Camp event. The overall distribution period was from August 2 to 26, 2007.

This was the last Generation 3 Pokemon distribution. For a Generation 3 distribution this was quite late on as Pokemon Diamond and Pearl had already been released in all regions with the exception of Korea by this point, marking the start of Pokemon Generation 4 in most regions.

So what do we have here? Well this is a rom dump of the Aura Mew event distribution used in the United Kingdom. You can use this to distribute yourself your own legitimate Aura Mew exactly as if you had attended one of the Aura Mew distributions 10 years ago back in 2007.
  
**Credits**

This release was made possible with significant financial contributions from the following people: Deoxyz, HaxAras, InsaneNutter, Invader Tak, Joska, Shank, theskipster, theSlayer, WALD0 and YoshiMoshi.

You might be surprised to learn that this Aura Mew distribution cost a significant amount of money to obtain, it’s thanks to the above contributors this has been preserved and yourself and future generations are able to enjoy this at no cost, the way it should be.

Everything that made this release possible has taken around a year’s worth of planning to come together.

**European Aura Mew Distributions**

Thanks to a collector who wishes to remain anonymous we are pleased to be able to release the French, German, Italian and Spanish regional variants of the Aura Mew Distribution, meaning the complete sets of these European distributions are finally available for all to enjoy. These were released on 23/12/18 and this post was updated to reflect that.

**Distributing the Aura Mew**

**Equipment Required**

- 2x GBA's
- 1x link cable (The official Nintendo cable works, 3rd party cables might not work)
- 1x Distribution Cart (This is what we have the rom of) so you can use a GBA Flash Card
- 1x Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen, FireRed cart which matches the language of the distribution you are using.

**Procedure**

1. Save your Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen, FireRed game and have at least 1 free slot in your party (the more free slots you have, the more Aura Mews you can distribute)
2. Turn off the GBA with your Pokemon Game in
3. Turn on the GBA with the distribution cart inside. (It is presumed that you know how to write and load the Aura Mew distribution rom to the flashcard you own)
4. Connect your GBA link cable to the GBA with the Aura Mew distribution in and the GBA with the Pokemon game in which will receive the Aura Mew
5. Turn on the GBA with your Pokemon game in which will receive the Aura Mew, holding Start and Select to enter Multiboot mode.
6. After a couple seconds you’ll see a coloured Nintendo logo appearing on the GBA which is going to recicve the Aura Mew.
7. You’ll see a screen that tells you a Pokemon is being received, after this has finished the Aura Mew will be in your party.
8. Now turn off the GBA which received the Aura Mew, turn it on again as normal and load your save game. You will find Aura Mew in your party.

**Troubleshooting**

The backup error message has no impact on the actual distribution, it simply saves a counter which will count the total number of Aura Mew's distributed.  
  
On emulators if you see the “Backup Error” message for the distribution counter this is because unlike the 10ANNIV distribution, the Aura Mew distribution actually saves the distribution count. For the saving to work properly on an emulator ensure the save type is set to "Flash 128K" and not "Flash 64K", otherwise it will display "Backup Error".  
  
For VisualBoyAdvance-M this can be done buy going to Options > Game Boy Advance > Configure > Flash Size = 128K.
  
If you get this error on real hardware this likely means the flashcard doesn't support 128K flash saves, however you can use the SRAM patcher functionality on GBATA to patch the rom.
  
I can confirm this works on a 15 year old Flash 2 Advance flashcard.
  
If you are using the Everdrive before loading the rom go down to "ROM Settings" and set "Save Type" to FLASH 128K, then select "Apply". After this the distribution counter should work as intended. This has been confirmed working by @Deoxyz
