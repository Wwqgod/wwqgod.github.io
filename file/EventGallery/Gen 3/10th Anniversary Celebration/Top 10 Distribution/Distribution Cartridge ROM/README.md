## Pokemon 10ANNIV Distribution Cartridge GBA ROM

**About the 10ANNIV Distribution Cartridge**

This is the distribution cartridge used for the Pokemon 10ANNIV event distributions in the United Kingdom, then later other European counties. These Pokemon were distributed for a limited time back in 2006 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Pokemon.

With this you can send a legit 10ANNIV Charizard, Pikachu, Articuno, Raikou, Entei, Suicune, Lugia, Ho-oh, Latias and Latios to your Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen or FireRed GBA Games.

**Credits**

@Deoxyz released a dump of his English distribution cartridge, costing a significant amount of money. All credit goes to him for making this available to the masses.

**European 10ANNIV Distributions**

Thanks to a collector who wishes to remain anonymous we are pleased to be able to release the French, German, Italian and Spanish regional variants of the 10ANNIV Distribution, meaning the complete sets of these European distributions are finally available for all to enjoy. These were released on 23/12/18 and this post was updated to reflect that.

**Distributing the 10ANNIV**

**Equipment Required**

- 2x GBA's
- 1x link cable (original cable works, 3rd party cables might not work)
- 1x Distribution cart, so you can use a GBA Flash Card or Emulator
- 1x Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen, FireRed cart from the language of the distribution you are using.

**Procedure**

1. Save in a Pokemon center and have at least 1 free slot in your party
2. Now turn off the receiving system.
3. Turn on the sending system with the distribution cart inside, connect with a link cable to the receiving system with the Pokemon 3rd gen cart inside and select the Pokemon to transfer.
4. Turn on the receiving system WITHOUT any cart inside, or hold start and select as you power the receiving system on, leaving the cartridge in
5. After a couple seconds you’ll see a colored Nintendo logo appearing on the receiving system. When you see it, put the Pokemon 3rd gen cart inside the receiving system. If you held start and select keeping the cartridge in, the distribution process will simply happen.
6. You’ll see a screen that tells you a Pokemon is being received. That Pokemon will be in your party.

**Troubleshooting**

Ensure you are using an a Pokemon game that matches the language of the distribution you are using, for example the English distribution and an English Pokemon game. It is not possible to mix and match different languages, however you can trade the Pokemon to a different language game once distributed.

You are following the procedure perfectly (receiving cart first not inserted, then inserted when Nintendo logo appears)

Have saved in a Pokemon center and have at least a free slot in the party

If the transfer gives you an error, try changing the link cable ( some 3rd cables don’t work), the gba systems or the receiving cart ( unofficial carts could not work).

It the cart suddenly doesn’t transfer Pokemon anymore then just turn both the systems off and on again.
