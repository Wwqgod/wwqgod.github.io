## Pokemon Berry Glitch Fix Shiny Zigzagoon Distribution Cartridge  GBA ROM

**About the Berry Glitch Fix Shiny Zigzagoon Distribution Cartridge**

This is the distribution cartridge used for distributing the Pokemon GBA Berry Glitch Fix Zigzagoon Distribution in stores throughout the United Kingdom.  
  
These specially made GBA cartridges were released to select stores across the UK. Players could visit these stores and connect to a GBA system containing one of these cartridges via link cable to download the patch, as well as receiving a shiny Zigzagoon holding a Liechi Berry. As with the GameCube demo discs, the program does not block fixed games, so the Zigzagoon can be received by the same cartridge multiple times.

Also interesting to note that it will also distribute to French, German, Italian, and Spanish games, and even Japanese! It'll be an English Zigzagoon on the Japanese game(character limit, so named ZIGZA), but it works.
  
Be aware if the battery in the GBA cartridge is dead then the distribution will refuse to work.
