Q: 
One question, how come the New York PC Pokemon haven't been put on the GBA section in the events download?

A: 
The problem with verifying whether or not they are legit is a few things:

The PID<->IVs do not conform to any known algorithm.

The machine's increased the trainer ID by 1 for each person who used it. This was ONLY reset when the machine was turned off, and even then it could have saved the last index for later usage.

There is no way to determine which ID went to which Pokemon. There were also 4 machines, A, B, C, D. Maybe someone else knows, but I haven't heard any clarification on how the set up was.

Was it A, B, C, D - each one had a diff Pokemon? Did you get one randomly? Did it cycle through them? Did each machine give you an option of which Pokemon you wanted? All of these things change how legality is determined. Were the trainer id's used more than once? How many people attended. Some say as little as 1000 per machine.

Without knowing exactly how the event was conducted, or having the machine's code, there is almost no way of determining legality.

Q:
Hi, why it marks ilegal on purpose?

A:
Because only the PIDIV algorithm is known; the species-PIDIV relationship isn't.

It's best to positively recognize them as PCNYx, but not give fake hacks a sense of validity.
