## Pokemon Aurora Ticket Distribution Cartridge GBA ROM

**About the Aurora Ticket Distribution Cartridge**

This is the distribution cartridge used to distribute the Aurora Ticket, an item which unlocks Birth Island on Pokemon FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald.
The distribution cartridge distributes the Aurora Ticket as a mystery gift using the GBA Wireless Adaptor to another GBA with a Wireless Adaptor connected. Once the other GBA has received the Aurora Ticket the player can travel to Birth Island to catch Deoxys.

This appears to be the US version of the distribution cartridge which will only distribute to FireRed and LeafGreen, not Emerald like the UK version of the cartridge does.

A massive thanks to Digiex member Deoxyz for purchasing and releasing this distribution cartridge, I know he has personally spent a lot of money on this and wanted nothing in return, expect that others enjoy it all these years later. So be sure to send him the love as without him it you would not have this distribution cartridge.

Since we originally obtained the Pokemon Gen 3 Aurora Ticket Distribution, for several years some private collectors who already possessed the newly public roms said that our version of the Aurora Ticket had a chunk of data erased from the hex. None of this effected the function of usage of the distribution, as it was all miscellaneous and unused data. Not long after we obtained the Doel Deoxys distribution in September 2018, we finally were able to obtain the alleged unedited Aurora Ticket rom. The data that was erased from the public copy before it came into our possession (further proof GBA devcarts are being rewritten with these) was revealed to be leftover data of the Japanese Aurora Ticket wondercard and Japanese wonder news about the event. None of this data is usable at the moment, however leftover data in distribution software is commonly found.  
  
Some examples you may remember being Negaiboshi / Wishing Star Jirachi hidden in the Wishmaker software, or the debug/test Pokemon hidden in some of the NDS roms. One day in the future this data may amount for something to be seen or used by the public, but for now the important aspect of this being public is that the original unedited Aurora Ticket Distribution is properly preserved along with all our other uneditedÂ Pokemon Gen 3 GBA Distributions.
